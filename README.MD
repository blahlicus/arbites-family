## Introduction
This is a .NET and [Eto.Forms](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) based GUI key rebinder for use by devices running the [Animus](https://github.com/blahlicus/animus-family) firmware. Arbites is fully cross-platform and can run on Windows, Linux, and Mac thanks for the wonders of Mono and Eto.Forms.

Arbites is designed to work together with Animus by providing an easy to use interface to rebind keys for Animus devices, Arbites works by converting user inputs into appropriate serial commands, then it sends the serial commands to Animus via the virtual serial port.
